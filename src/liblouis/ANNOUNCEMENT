The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.30.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

We are very excited to bring this release as a lot of enthusiasm and
energy has been gone into it. A lot of of new contributors have improved
liblouis and added support for new languages to it. We now have support
for many ancient languages like Akkadian, Ugaritic, Biblical Hebrew or
Syriac. There is also support for Yiddish now. Also the Dutch tables got
a very innovative upgrade.

I'd like to thank all the very dedicated contributors for helping to
bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

New features
------------

-  There is a new uncontracted braille table for Yiddish, created by
   Abby Howell and Matthew Shifrin, a teacher and student of Yiddish at
   the Boston Worker's Circle.
-  A group of incredibly dedicated people has been working on support
   for ancient languages, namely Matt Yeater and Paul Geoghegan with the
   help of Sarah Blake LaRose, Eric Harvey, Leonard de Ruijter and Abby
   Howell. The languages that are supported so far are:

   -  Biblical Hebrew
   -  Akkadian according to Borger system
   -  Akkadian braille according to U.S. system
   -  Syriac
   -  Ugaritic
   -  A table to provide support for the languages represented in the
      Cuneiform / Akkadian Writing systems

Bug fixes
---------

-  Fix a bug in the Python bindings that occurs on bigendian
   architectures, thanks to Daniel Garcia.
-  Fix a memory problem when handling parameters in ``lou_translate``,
   thanks to benehalo.

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  Minor improvements to the Danish tables thanks to Bue
   Vester-Andersen:

   -  Fixed a missing contraction for "gjorde".

-  Improvements to Hungarian (added more exceptions) thanks to Attila
   Hammer.
-  Corrections to the Malay Table thanks to lbk2907.
-  Major improvements to Serbian backtranslation thanks to Aleksandar
   Sredojevic:

   -  Backtranslation now works to both Cyrillic and Latin script.

-  Fix the metadata for the Cantonese (Hong Kong) table thanks to André
   Polykanine.
-  Improvements to backtranslation of Spanish grade 2 thanks to Iván
   Argote Pérez with the help of Abby Howell.
-  Major upgrade to the Dutch tables thanks to Bert Frees. These tables
   use virtual dots in an innovative way to help sighted readers better
   understand the generated braille. They also use a new technique using
   ``m4`` macros to simplify writing tables that use many repetitive
   opcodes.

Other changes
-------------

-  The metadata now has support for ``unicode-range``, i.e. whether the
   characters used in a table all fall inside the ``0-U+FFFF`` Unicode
   range (``ucs2``), or whether some characters are in the >
   ``U+10000-U+10FFFF`` range (``ucs4``), thanks to Bert Frees.
