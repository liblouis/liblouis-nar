https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release stands in the tradition of small incremental improvements
that make it another fine and solid release. Andrey Yakuboy put in a lot
of work to improve Russian literary and computer braille. He also
provided a new table for Belarusian uncontracted and computer braille.
Aside from that there are numerous improvements in Braille tables such
as French, Polish and Urdu. The documentation has been improved as has
the table meta marking the tables whether they are geared towards
forward or backwards translation. I'd like to thank everybody for
helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.
