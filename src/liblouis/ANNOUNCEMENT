liblouis 3.25.0 has been released

The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.25.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

We dedicate this release to the memory of John Boyer, the original
author of liblouis. Sadly he passed away recently. We owe him a
tremendous amount of gratitude. Without him liblouis would not exist.

A lot of work has gone into this release. We have quite a few security
related fixes. Then there are updates to Dutch, Norwegian, Slovenian and
Vietnamese. Attila, who never seems to get tired, updated the Hungarian
tables and did some general cleanups in the tables.

Also due to some mishap our domain expired and we could not re-acquire
it. So we had to change our domain to ``liblouis.io``.

I'd like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

New features
------------

Bug fixes
---------

-  Fixed several buffer overflow errors in ``lou_setDataPath``,
   ``lou_logFile`` and ``resolveSubtable`` thanks to Marsman1996.

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  Fix a deprecation warning in Bulgarian 6 dots thanks to Attila
   Hammer.
-  Fix two broken space replacement rules for ZERO WIDTH SPACE and WORD
   JOINER thanks to Attila Hammer and Norbert Markus.
-  Fixes to Hungarian Braille exceptions and hyphenation thanks to
   Attila Hammer. This results in a much improved back-translation of
   capitalized words.
-  Support for both 8 and 6 dot math symbols in Hungarian thanks to
   Norbert Markus.
-  Update Dutch 8-dot computer braille table to the 2022 standard thanks
   to Leonard de Ruijter and the Dutch Braille Authority.
-  There are updates to the Norwegian braille standard. Most notably
   URLs and email addresses are no longer surrounded by braille patterns
   unless present in the original document. Thanks to Lars Bjørndal.
-  Add some missing character definitions to Slovenian computer braille,
   thanks to Jožef Gregorc.
-  Corrections and additions to Vietnamese thanks to Dang Hoai Phúc.
   Includes a new computer braille table.

Other changes
-------------

-  Change the domain name from liblouis.org to liblouis.io thanks to
   Christian Egli.
-  Simplify the Danish test to contain fewer files thanks to Bue
   Vester-Andersen and Bert Frees.
-  Add the tests and the examples of the Python bindings to the
   distribution tarball. Thanks to Rob Beezer for spotting this
   oversight.

Deprecation notice
------------------

-  The ``lou_setDataPath`` and ``lou_getDataPath`` functions have been
   deprecated. Please migrate to one of the other ways to set the table
   search path:

   -  The recommended and most straightforward way to set the search
      path is to set the ``LOUIS_TABLEPATH`` environment variable.
   -  You can also set a custom table resolver function through
      ``lou_registerTableResolver``.
   -  If you use the metadata based query API and haven't set the
      ``LOUIS_TABLEPATH`` environment variable, you can use the
      ``lou_indexTables`` function to tell Liblouis which files (not
      directories) to search.
   -  Finally, there is the fallback solution of using absolute file
      paths.

Share and Enjoy!
