liblouis 3.16.0 has been released

The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.16.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release is mostly the work of Bert Frees. He has put in a lot of
work and pushed some major improvements with regards to how emphasis is
handled (and how this is documented). He fixed a crash when reading URLs
using computer braille. He also worked with many contributors to get
their improvements in. So we have better support for UEB, Dutch, Urdu,
Malayalam, Arabic, Bashkir, Uzbek, Russian computer braille and for
EBAE. I'd like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

New features
------------

-  A new opcode ``noemphchars`` was added. This gives you more control
   over the placement and scope of various emphasis indicators. Thanks
   to Bert Frees.

Bug fixes
---------

-  Fix an endless loop when using ``compbrlAtCursor`` thanks to Bert
   Frees

-  Improvements to contraction use in UEB thanks to James Bowden. In
   particular the checkmark (U+2713) is added, the emdash (U+2014) is
   fixed, the right single quote used as apostrophe between letters is
   fixed and finally some more accented letters have been added.

-  Multiple improvements to the Russian literary braille thanks to
   Andrey Yakuboy and Bert Frees:

   -  Many new symbols (punctuation, bullets, math symbols, etc) have
      been added.
   -  The table now includes the international phonetic alphabet table.
   -  Punctuation after digits and fractions is now marked with dot 6 to
      avoid ambiguities.
   -  Other changes to conform better with Russian braille rules.
   -  A new table that indicates capital letters was added. This is the
      new recommended Russian table for braille display users.

      ``ru-litbrl-detailed.utb``.
