The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.26.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release contains one new feature, namely the possibility to mark a
test as an expected failure just for back- or forward translation. On
top of that we have updates for Danish, Hungarian, Norwegian and Nemeth
Braille plus the usual assortment of code cleanups and bug fixes.

I'd like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

New features
------------

-  The YAML syntax to define tests has been improved so that expected
   failures can now contain a direction attribute. In other words you
   can now specify whether you expect a test to fail for both directions
   or just for forward or backward translation. For more details consult
   the updated documentation on how to write YAML tests. Thanks to
   Christian Egli.

Bug fixes
---------

-  Fix an out-of-bound write in ``brl_checks.c`` thanks to Bert Frees
   for the fix and to Han Zheng for the report.
-  Clear the display table cache on ``lou_free`` thanks to Bert Frees
   for the fix and to David Korczynski for the report.

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  Improvements to Hungarian (added more exceptions) thanks to Attila
   Hammer.
-  Changed the Danish grade 2 tables in accordance with updates from the
   Danish Braille committee, thanks to thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.
-  Added support for more symbols in the Nemeth braille tables thanks to
   Norbert Markus.
-  Improvements to Norwegian braille thanks to Lars Bjørndal

   -  Put ``noback`` before acute sign to enable input at sign (email
      addresses).
   -  Added more ``noback`` prefixes.
   -  Corrected leftwards arrow and added definition for left right
      arrow.
   -  Changed bullet point from 2356 to 36-36. According to the
      Norwegian braille standard, this is the preferred unordered list
      item prefix.

Other changes
-------------

-  Clarify the ``README`` for Python thanks to Rob Beezer.
-  Properly remove support for Python2 in the Python bindings again
