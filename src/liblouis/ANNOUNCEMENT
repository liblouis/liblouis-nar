liblouis 3.10.0 has been released

The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.10.0. The release is available for download at:

    https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[1].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion
project liblouisutdml[2] deals with formatting of braille.

Changes in this release
=======================

This release comes across as quiet, containing just the usual
assortment of braille table improvements, cleanups, bug fixes and the
classic buffer overflow patches. But beware, a lot has happened behind
the scenes. Bert and Davy have been adding a new opcode to handle
special emphasis situations. A number of annoying restrictions with
regards to names, such as class names have been removed thank to Bert.
And lastly also thanks to Bert it is now possible to define inline
display tables in your YAML tests.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues[3].

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add a new opcode `emphmodechars'. Thanks to Bert Frees and Davy
  Kager.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Remove memoization in `checkAttr'. It wasn't implemented correctly,
  caused some weird bugs and probably didn't do much for performance.
  Thanks to Bert Frees.
- Fix multiple buffer overflows in `compilePassOpcode'. Thanks to
  Cheng Wen for the report and to Christian Egli for the fix.
- Fix a build problem when building without libyaml thanks to Bert
  Frees.


Braille table improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added modified letters to UEB thanks to Mike Gray.
- Complete overhaul of the U.S. six-dot computer braille tables to
  align with the CBC standard thanks to Timothy Wynn. There is now a
  sub-table for EBAE (`en-us-compbrl.uti') and a stand-alone table
  (`en-us-comp6.ctb').
  - Conforms to the CBC standard from BANA for character definitions
    that differ from the 8-dot ASCII braille (11 punctuation marks).
  - Added rules for braille indicators, emphasis indicators, and
    isolated lower-cell signs to the stand-alone table.
  - Uncontracted and contracted EBAE tables no longer use dot 7 when
    in computer braille mode.
  - `en-us-compbrl.ctb' was deleted because it was identical to
    `en-us-comp6.ctb'.
- Update Bopomofo-based Chinese Braille thanks to Sponge Jhan
  - Correct various dot patterns of Chinese characters.
  - Add more known pattern exceptions of Chinese characters.
  - Apply `word' opcode to 倔 and 据.
  - Change dot pattern of ＆ to 456-12346.
- `de-de-comp8.ctb' now has definitions for musical Unicode characters
  thanks to Daniel Mayr
- Emphasis improvements in Unified French 6 dots Braille thanks to
  Ludovic Oger.
- Improvements to Unified English braille, Grade 2 thanks to James
  Datray from Freedom Scientific.
- Numerous back-translation fixes to Grade 2 of UK English and Unified
  English Braille thanks to Anthony Tibbs.
- Updates to Dutch Braille thanks to Bert Frees
  - Hyphen cancels the effect of emphasis indicator
  - Left/right curly brackets
  - Write currency symbols in full if they come after the number


Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remove various restrictions on which characters and braille cells
  can be used in translation rules, thanks to Bert Frees.
- Remove some code duplication in `pattern.c' thanks to Bert Frees
- It is now also possible to define inline tables when a display table
  has been defined thanks to Bert Frees
- Nightly snapshots of liblouis are now also built for win64 thanks to
