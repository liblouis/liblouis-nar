# The Romanian uncontracted braille table is based on the French uncontracted
# braille table and was created with the help of Gosa Tudor, Papp Levente,
# Trutiu Florin and Patru Aurel from BAUM Engineering Romania. It has been
# tested and used in multiple schools and associations.

# Unfortunately there is no official documentation for Romanian braille as there
# are no universal rules that apply. There are different rules based on
# different regions or schools.

# This table was made by us in collaboration with a local blind teacher and we
# also distributed it for the last 2 years.
