# Test for issue #615: The always opcode unworking after the numeral (https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/615)

table: |
  letter x 1
  letter y 2
  letter z 3
  always xy 3
  digit 4 4
  letter a 5
  sign . 6
  numsign 6
tests:
  - - 4xy
    - .4z

# The presence of the "numericnocontchars" rule enables numeric mode
# processing. If the nocontractsign is defined then contractions are
# disabled upon entering numeric mode and only enabled again upon
# reaching the next space. In this test the nocontractsign is not
# defined so the "xy" should be contracted because there is no space
# after the "4"
